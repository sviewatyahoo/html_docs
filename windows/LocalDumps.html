        <p>If you experience application crashes you may be asked by support to create a crash dump file. Crash dumps are created automatically by Windows if the following registry key is present:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Error Reporting\LocalDumps

            In order to help support troubleshoot your problem please do the following:</p>

    <p>Create the registry key LocalDumps if it is not present already.</p>
    <p>Reproduce the problem (i.e. make the application crash).</p>
    <p>Locate the crash dump file in %LOCALAPPDATA%\CrashDumps. Note that if the crashing application runs under the System account, that resolves to C:\Windows\System32\config\systemprofile\AppData\Local\CrashDumps.</p>
    <p>Send the crash dump file to support. </p>

    <p>This works on all versions of Windows beginning with Vista and Server 2008 (including Windows 7, Windows 8, Server 2012, etc.).</p>
