<h2>WinLAMP, she installed successfully.</h2>

<p>If you can see this, it means that the installation of the Apache web server 
software on this system was successful. </p>

<p>See <a href="http://localhost/index.php">PHPINFO</a> to view your PHP 
configuration, and <a href="http://localhost/phpmyadmin/">phpMyAdmin</a> 
(if you chose to install it) 
will allow you to begin working with MySQL immediately.</p>

<p>If you chose to install the Apache, PHP, and MySQL manuals, 
they are now available in your Start / Programs / WinLAMP menu.
