    Analysis Service Time Precision
    <pre>
    Periodic Time Rule has a limit of 120Hz. 
    Natural time rule can distinguish 10 micro second difference.

(1) Formulating Performance Equation
The end result of the formulation is config string, time rule, and analysis rule. 
Once a user checked in, then all information will be stored on AF side. 

(2) Push into the service
Once Af server gets change events and it will notify to all subscribers. 
Analysis service is one of the subscribers. There are two changes mechanism: coarse change and fine change events.

(3) Service picking up the equation
Analysis Service gets changes from Af server.
